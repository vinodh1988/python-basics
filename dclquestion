-- Case Study: Managing Database Access for a New Intern

-- Scenario:
-- The IT department at "ABC School" has hired a new intern who needs limited access to the school's database.
-- As the database administrator at "ABC School", you are responsible for managing access to the school's database. 
-- A new intern has joined the IT department and requires limited access to the 'school' database.

-- Your tasks are as follows:
-- 1. Create a new user account for the intern named 'intern' with a secure password.
-- 2. Grant the intern permission to view and add records in all tables of the 'school' database.
-- 3. Verify the permissions assigned to the intern.
-- 4. Later, the intern's role changes and they should only be able to view records, not add them. Update their permissions accordingly.
-- 5. Confirm that the intern's permissions have been updated.
-- 6. At the end of the internship, remove the intern's access to the database completely.

-- Complete each step using appropriate MySQL Data Control Language (DCL) commands.
